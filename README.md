## Developer Notes:
For this project I was tasked with developing a burger logger to create, track & eat delicious burgers.

Starting out I was able to use some boilerplate code from an in class activity that helped me alot.  However once I got near the end and tried to check that the functionality worked I found that it did not.  After trying to debug on my own I was able to get some other eyes on it from classmates and TA and that helped solve my problems.  Overall was alot of work to put together but very satisfying once it was working.
